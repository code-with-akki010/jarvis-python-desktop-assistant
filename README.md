# Jarvis - Python Desktop Assistant

![Jarvis Python Desktop Assistant](assets/jarvis-banner.png)

Jarvis is a terminal-based Python desktop assistant built for quick local tasks. It accepts typed commands, speaks responses using text-to-speech, opens websites, launches Windows apps, opens folders, searches YouTube, opens Google News, tells the time/date, tells programming jokes, and falls back to Google Search for unknown commands.

This version is designed to be reliable on normal desktops and laptops without requiring a microphone, speech recognition, API keys, databases, or paid cloud services.

## Features

- Open popular websites: Google, YouTube, Gmail, Instagram, WhatsApp Web, and GitHub.
- Launch Windows applications: Notepad, Calculator, Paint, and Command Prompt.
- Open common local folders: Desktop, Downloads, Documents, and Pictures.
- Search or play songs through YouTube search results.
- Open Google News top stories.
- Tell the current time and date.
- Tell random programming jokes using `pyjokes`.
- Search Google automatically for unknown commands.
- Speak responses using `pyttsx3`.
- Stop cleanly with `exit`, `quit`, or `stop`.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Python | Main programming language |
| `pyttsx3` | Offline text-to-speech output |

## Notes And Limitations

- This project uses typed terminal commands, not microphone input.
- Voice recognition was removed so the assistant can work on systems without a microphone.
- Hugging Face API, NewsAPI, and screenshot features were removed or replaced for reliability.
- App-launching and folder-opening commands are Windows-focused.
- The `play` command opens YouTube search results instead of directly controlling YouTube playback.
- `pyjokes` is optional at runtime; if it is missing, Jarvis tells the user to install it.

## Future Improvements

- Add a simple graphical user interface.
- Add command history.
- Add custom user-defined shortcuts.
- Add support for more Windows applications.
- Add cross-platform support for macOS and Linux.
- Add optional voice input only when a microphone is available.
